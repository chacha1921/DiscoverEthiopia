                                <p>Awash National Park is one of the national parks of Ethiopia. Spanning across the
                                    southern tip of the Afar Region and the northeastern corner of the Misraq Shewa Zone
                                    of Oromia, this park is 225 kilometers east of Addis Ababa (and a few kilometers
                                    west of Awash), with its southern boundary along the Awash River, and covers 756
                                    square kilometers of acacia woodland and grassland. The Addis Ababa - Dire Dawa
                                    highway passes through this park, separating the Illala Saha Plains to the south
                                    from the Kudu Valley to the north. In the south of the park the Awash River gorge
                                    has amazing waterfalls. In the upper Kudu Valley at Filwoha are hot springs amid
                                    groves of palm trees. The Awash National Park was established in 1966, although the
                                    act authorizing its existence was not completely passed for another three years. In
                                    establishing this park, as well as the Metehara Sugar Plantation to the south, the
                                    livelihoods of the Karayyu Oromo people indigenous to that area have been
                                    endangeredâ€”an effect that is contrary to the Ethiopian government's original
                                    intention of these establishments serving to benefit the local population</p>

                                <p>Simien Mountains National Park is one of the national parks of Ethiopia. Located in
                                    the Semien (North) Gondar Zone of the Amhara Region, its territory covers the Semien
                                    Mountains and includes Ras Dashan, the highest point in Ethiopia. It is home to a
                                    number of endangered species, including the Ethiopian wolf and the walia ibex, a
                                    wild goat found nowhere else in the world. The gelada baboon and the caracal, a cat,
                                    also occur within the Simien Mountains. More than 50 species of birds inhabit the
                                    park, including the impressive bearded vulture, or lammergeier, with its 3 m (10
                                    ft)) wingspan.[2]<br><br>The park is crossed by an unpaved road which runs from
                                    Debarq, where the administrative headquarters of the park is located, east through a
                                    number of villages to the Buahit Pass (4,430 m), where the road turns south to end
                                    at Mekane Berhan, 10 kilometers beyond the park boundary.</p>

                                    located in the Oromia Region and the Ethiopian Highlands region, 200 kilometers
                                    south of Addis Ababa, and east of the Ziwayâ€“Shashamane highway.<br>It contains 887
                                    square kilometers including the Rift Valley lakes of Abijatta and Shalla. The two
                                    lakes are separated by three kilometers of hilly land. The altitude of the park
                                    ranges from 1540 to 2075 meters, the highest peak being Mount Fike, which is
                                    situated between the two lakes.<br>Besides the two lakes, the primary attraction of
                                    this national park are a number of hot springs on the northeast corner of Lake
                                    Abijatta, and large numbers of flamingoes on the lake.[1] Care must be exercised in
                                    driving vehicles out to the edge of this lake, as the thin crust of dried mud on the
                                    surface can give way without warning.<br></p>

                                <p>The Omo National Park - one of the Ethiopia's largest and richest nature sanctuary
                                    and yet one of the least visited areas in East and Central Africa. Located on the
                                    west bank of the Omo River, the park covers approximately 4,068 square kilometers,
                                    about 870 kilometers southwest of Addis Ababa. The Mago National Park, is located on
                                    the eastern bank of the Omo river. Although an airstrip was recently built near the
                                    park headquarters on the Mui River, this park is not easily reachable.<br></p>
